Why Rogue One is so high - Diana McSpadden's unasked for opinion

Rogue One is the only Star Wars movies to follow a character from childhood to adulthood. The other movies rely on additional movies to provide background on characters. Despite criticism that Rogue One had underdeveloped characters, I found the standard backstory of losing one’s parents (mother dead, father kidnapped) effective for setting up Jyn’s hero quest. It also becomes clear that Jyn’s quest is what makes all of movies 4, 5 and 6 possible – so the stakes are high. This is the only Star Wars movie that I cried while watching. I am a sucker for lead characters who sacrifice themselves for the cause (yes, I know Obi-Wan sacrifices himself, but that death wasn’t as emotionally charged for me – it happened midway through Episode 4, and it appeared to only protect a small group of people, rather than Jyn’s sacrifice that protects the entire rebellion.
