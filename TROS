TROS is actually a masterclass of how to completely remove all stakes from a film by moving the plot only through contrivance. At every corner there are instaces of, caves that hold the map to the last wayfinder,
big bads being ressurected under the flimsly explaination of "the dark side of the force is a pathway to many abilities that some consider to be unnatural", and older characters showing up as an ex machina, not once but TWICE. 
All of these have no function other than to sloppily progress the plot forward while simutanioulsy adding some sort of confusing fan service.


Some areas of the movie do shine however, such as the perfectly crafted scene wherein the knights of Ren were introduced. As an casual audience member myself, I really 
appreciated the part where we were told that the party of brutes and warriors accompanying Kylo Ren where call the "Knights of Ren, cool".
