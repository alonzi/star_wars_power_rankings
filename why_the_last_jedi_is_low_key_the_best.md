Asside from several plot issues, most of the issues hardcore fans have with this movie is that is strays too far from their expectatios.  Ray's parents not being special is a perfect example.

However, starwars movies are supposed to have big revelations that actually surprise the audience.  The revelation that ray was a decendent of palpatine was way more predicatble than ray not being a decendent of anyone.  Kylo killing his master and taking things in his own direction was also a great twist.

Finally, the best thing about last jedi is the underlying theme of focusing on the little guy rather than these big heros.  You have millions of rebel fighters, all with their own stories of struggle and sacrifice and throughout the rest of the cannon these people are largely ignored.  This movie made that struggle real for me in a way that never did before.  The opening with the last bomber trying to drop it's payload was awesome.

That being said I've only seen it once (I tried to watch it again and couldn't).
